## To Do Before UQBIO

Hello students! Here's a list of what you should do before the beginning of the summer school on June 1st.

### Create a Github account

A github account will allow you to collaborate and save code among your group when working on the project side of the summer school.

A free account allows you to make public repositories for code.

(Optional) With a university email you can request a student account which will allow you to make private repositories.  You have to fill out a short form saying what you are going to use the student account for and it typically takes a day to be approved. A private repo doesnt pull directly into github as nicely, it requires an oauth token, so its easier to keep your project public.
